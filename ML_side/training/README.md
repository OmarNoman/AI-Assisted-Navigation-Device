# Controlled navigation-model training

`train_navigation_model.py` is the local-only foundation for a future WalkBuddy navigation-model candidate. It does not establish model quality, legal approval, privacy compliance, or production readiness.

## Inputs and eligibility

Start from [`../config/training_navigation_mvp.yaml`](../config/training_navigation_mvp.yaml), then use a reviewed local copy. The configuration must reference a repository-relative manifest and local model architecture (`.yaml`/`.yml`) or initial weights (`.pt`), never a URL or a bare Ultralytics model identifier. Exactly one model source is required.

The manifest must pass the bundled validator with `--check-files` semantics, use the approved eight-class taxonomy, have `dataset.release_decision: approved_for_training`, and record an approved licence review that permits machine-learning use. Of the manifest decisions, only `approved_for_training` is accepted; `draft`, `under_review`, `rejected`, `retired`, and `example_only` are rejected. The configuration stage must be `approved_for_internal_training` or `released`; `candidate`, `in_review`, and `rejected` are deliberately ineligible. The YOLO YAML must use the exact same ordered taxonomy and physically contain each manifest sample beneath its declared split. If an inspection report is supplied, its verdict must not be `fail`.

The versioned configuration records the experiment name; manifest/YAML references; explicit stage; exactly one local model source; epochs, image size, batch, device, workers, seed, optimiser, learning rate, confidence, IoU, deterministic preference, resume behaviour, output root, and notes. Unknown fields are rejected. Epochs, image size, batch, workers, and seed are positive non-boolean integers; learning rate, confidence, and IoU are finite non-negative numbers. Device values are deliberately limited to `cpu`, `auto`, `mps`, `cuda`, `cuda:<index>`, or a numeric GPU index. Dataset roots are intentionally supplied at execution with `--dataset-root` rather than committed.

## Dry run

Use an existing controlled local dataset root. The root is not recorded in output metadata.

```powershell
python .\ML_side\training\train_navigation_model.py `
  --config .\ML_side\config\training_navigation_mvp.yaml `
  --dataset-root D:\controlled-datasets\navigation-mvp-v1 `
  --dry-run
```

A dry run validates configuration, manifest, local dataset files, YAML, model file, eligibility, output safety, and any inspection evidence. It creates no run directory, weights, or trainer output and never imports or invokes Ultralytics.

## Explicit real training

Real training is blocked unless `--confirm-training` is supplied; combining it with `--dry-run` is rejected. It uses only an existing local model path, sets `YOLO_OFFLINE=true` and disables Weights & Biases mode before the trainer is imported, and does not download datasets or weights. A remote URL, URI, traversal attempt, absolute path in the committed configuration, or missing local file fails preflight. These safeguards do not claim to prove that every future Ultralytics version suppresses all telemetry.

```powershell
python .\ML_side\training\train_navigation_model.py `
  --config .\local-training-navigation-mvp.yaml `
  --dataset-root D:\controlled-datasets\navigation-mvp-v1 `
  --confirm-training
```

The harmless `--epochs`, `--batch-size`, `--device`, `--workers`, and repository-relative `--output-root` overrides are recorded in the resolved plan. Existing run directories are protected unless `--allow-existing-run` and the configured resume policy permit reuse.

## Artifacts and reproducibility

Real runs write ignored artifacts under `ML_side/artifacts/navigation_mvp/<run-id>/`: `run_metadata.json`, `resolved_training_config.json`, `dataset_reference.json`, `training_summary.md`, and any trainer output. Metadata files are replaced atomically where supported. Metadata records checksums, the fixed taxonomy, dataset release stage/version, Git commit/dirty state, seed, parameters, package versions, Python/OS information, status, and failure summary. It deliberately omits the absolute dataset root, credentials, and environment dumps. A trainer failure is recorded as failed and leaves partial trainer output for investigation; it is never marked successful.

The run ID is stable for unchanged configuration, manifest, dataset YAML, and local model file checksums. A completed run is therefore not silently overwritten.

## Verification

```powershell
$env:PYTHONPATH = (Resolve-Path .\ML_side).Path
python -m pytest .\ML_side\tests\test_train_navigation_model.py -q
python -m pytest .\ML_side\tests -q
python .\ML_side\training\train_navigation_model.py --help
```

Keep datasets, weight files, and generated artifacts in controlled external storage. Dataset inspection precedes this pipeline; formal evaluation of a trained candidate remains a separate later step.
